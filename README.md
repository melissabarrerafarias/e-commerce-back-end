# E-commerce Back End 

## Description 
AS A manager at an internet retail company

I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies

SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

That is what this application was made for. You can get all the information from your database of your companies categories, products, and tags. You can also create, update, or delete any item of you choosing! 

## Installation 
To use this application, you need to clone the repo and open your terminal. You'll also need the application Insomnia, or a similar one, to check out the routes in their fullest potential. 

## Usage
In your terminal, open the MYSQL CLI and run the command "source db/schema.sql". Once the database is created, exit the MYSQL CLI and run "npm run seed" in your terminal. This will seed the information into your database. Finally start the server by running "node server.js" or "npm start". Then open Insomnia, or the application you prefer, and you are ready to test the routes for yourself! If it sounds a bit complicated... check out this walkthrough video I made for you!
